    <h1><em>Wander</em></h1>
    <p>Wander was designed by people who have a love for culture and travel.
    <br>
    To often you embark on an adventure and meet incredible people,
    see amazing sights, eat great food and pause where ever you can to
    capture that memory with a photo.
    <br>
    When you revisit that trip by scrolling through your photos,
    or making a photo album, often you come across a shot of that
    person you had a great conversation with, remember it was in Tokyo
    but where exactly was that? It’s hard to remember because half the
    time you didn’t know where you were to begin with.
    <br>
    Wander will take the photographs of your journey and and map out
    where they were taken.
    <br>
    Wander will then place them by location over a google maps image of
    the area and create a route based on your photos, so you will know
    exactly where the photos were taken and the route you took.
    <br>
    No longer will  you forget where you were when you took that amazing shot.
    <br>
    Welcome to the new way of capturing your memories and sharing them with the world. </p>
