      Wander was designed by people who have a love for culture and travel. <br>
      It is an app that will allow you to capture your memories and save them
      to an album. <br><br>
      This album will show your photos, and the route
      you took by embedding the images into a google map view.<br><br>
      This will allow you to see the route you took and each place you took a photo.<br><br>
      To start, log in with your flicker account and create your first memory.<br><br>
